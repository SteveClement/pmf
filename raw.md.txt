               Programming Methodology Framework aka PMF
            draft-dulaunoy-programming-methodology-framework

Abstract

   This document describes the Programming Methodology Framework also
   known under the PMF methodology.  The methodology is based on the
   manifesto written by Zed A.  Shaw [PROGRAMMING-MF-MANIFESTO] which
   describes a natural approach to software engineering especially on
   the strong focus towards the act of programming.  The PM methodology
   uses a soft naming to allow a non-partisan reference into official
   engineering or project documents to describe one of the most used
   software engineering methodology.

1.  Introduction

   In 2011, Zed A.  Shaw published a blog post which describes:

   I think I'm going to create the ultimate software development
   methodology.  It'll be revolutionary compared to others because it
   will focus on the one thing that gets software done.  Its entire
   focus will be this one, glorious, completely useful activity for
   writing software.  It's name even embodies the perfection of this
   programming methodology.

   The programming methodology was published as a manifesto later
   [PROGRAMMING-MF-MANIFESTO].  The manifesto clearly describes the
   focus on programming to avoid the surrounding management overhead and
   pivot towards the delivery of the software.  The
   [THE-TAO-OF-PROGRAMMING] describes similar methodologies which
   strongly focus on coding, scripting and programming.

   The overall concept of PMF methodology follows this iteration:

   o  Write a list of things to be done and use an iterative programming
      process.

   o  Do some of the things with additional programming.

   o  Build testing and tests using programming.

   This process is run in a while loop until the software is delivered.

1.1.  Management and PMF methodology

   A simple management process is required in addition to the PMF
   methodology.  The management process is complementary to the PMF
   metholody and not interfering with the programming aspect.  The
   management process is there to support the PMF methodology.

   o  Review requirements of the users/customers by asking them.

   o  Give the list of things to be done to the programmers.

   o  Review the delivered software to see if it matches the
      requirements.

1.2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Security Considerations

   Secure and defensive programming can only come by practicing
   programming and this also includes the act of simplifying or removing
   code to reduce the attack surface.

3.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank all the programmers who program.
